Next.js 15 UI/UX Guide â€“ shadcn/ui Best Practices & Design System
ðŸŽ¨ Quick Start UI/UX Checklist

Essential Setup for Consistent, Professional UI:
Use shadcn/ui components as the foundation of your UI.
Always follow design system color tokens like bg-primary or text-muted-foreground.
Keep spacing and typography consistent throughout the app.
Create reusable components and patterns instead of duplicating UI.
Make sure everything is accessible to screen readers and keyboard users.
Use semantic HTML (meaningful tags like <header>, <main>).

1. shadcn/ui Component Usage â€“ Best Practices

Usage Patterns:
Correct usage: Always apply design system classes (like bg-card, text-foreground, bg-primary). This ensures theming works automatically in light and dark mode.
Incorrect usage: Donâ€™t hardcode colors (like bg-white or text-gray-600). It breaks the theme and consistency.
